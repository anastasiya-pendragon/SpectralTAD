Description: SpectralTAD is an R package designed to identify Topologically Associating Domains 
from contact matrices. It uses a modified version of spectral clustering that uses a window to 
quickly detect TADs. The function works on a range of different types of contact matrices and
returns a bed file of TAD coordinates. The method does not require users to adjust any parameters
to work and gives them control over the number of hierarchical levels to be returned.
