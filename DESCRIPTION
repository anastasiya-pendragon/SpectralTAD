Description: 
    SpectralTAD is an R package designed to identify Topologically Associated 
    Domains (TADs) from Hi-C contact matrices. It uses a modified version of 
    spectral clustering that uses a sliding window to quickly detect TADs. 
    The function works on a range of different formats of contact matrices 
    and returns a bed file of TAD coordinates. The method does not require 
    users to adjust any parameters to work and gives them control over 
    the number of hierarchical levels to be returned.
