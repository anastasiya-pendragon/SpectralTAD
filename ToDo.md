# John's review

+ warning messages when installing package from github:
    
- math text isn't displaying correctly in README.md (Not sure if math text can be used for .md)
+ link to vignette in README should probably be changed to seen by `browseVignettes("SpectralTAD")` since it just links to the raw version of the vignette on github.
+ in README maybe have some introduction - explain what TADs are and what levels are
+ why are there 2 license files? should only be 1
+ need a line in README for installing dependancies (Don't see why this is necessary)
